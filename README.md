# giphslide
Generate a random slidedeck using Giphy. Create a `slides.txt` file with one slide title on each line, then run `ruby giphslide.rb`. Your resulting deck will be generated as `slides.html`. When opened in the browser, it'll load your slides and give you an alert when it's finished. You can now use the arrow keys for slide navigation.
